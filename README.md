# Project 0x16 - simple_shell :rock:
## simple_shell
* The C shell is an interactive command interpreter and a command programming language. It uses syntax that is similar to the C programming language. The csh command starts the C shell. When you log in, the csh command first searches the system-wide setup file /etc/csh.
* This is a collaborative project made by David James Taiye and Daniel Bassey Nyong, Students of Software Engineering at ALX/Holberton school. This Repo contains files for the **Simple_Shell Project**. The project requires us to develop our own UNIX command interpreter (shell).

### Examples :goat:
Example of error with sh:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
Same error with our program hsh:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```
## Requirements :shell:
This simple_shell project is designed to run on the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, and can be compiled using the options -wall - werror -wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
The code should use the [Betty style](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty).

## Features
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command.
* If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
* Handle errors
* Hand the EOF(Ctrl + D) condition.
* Handle the Ctrl +C to not terminate the shell.
* Handle th command line with arguments.
* Handle the PATH.
* Support the exit features.

## Builtins :house:
* exit 'terminates the shell'
* env 'display the environment'
